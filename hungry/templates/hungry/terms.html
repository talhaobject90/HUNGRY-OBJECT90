                            <span class="text fgColor_333333 fontStyleRegular">A 3rd party vendor has been contracted to perform your delivery service.  In order to ensure that your delivery is successful, your participation is needed.  Below are answers to commonly asked questions about IKEA deliveries :<br>
<br>
<a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a><b>1.1 When will I receive my delivery? </b><p></p>
<p> In the shopping cart, you will receive an Estimated Delivery Date.  Please note that this is not a guaranteed delivery date for your order.  Some areas may take longer due to the frequency of deliveries to the delivery zip code.  Our system calculates this estimated date considering the total amount of time to process your order including: packaging, transit time to the delivery provider, and transit time to the delivery address.</p>
<br>
When placing your order, we consider these factors when calculating the Estimated Delivery Date :<br>
<ul>
<li>Order Processing: The amount of time it takes for us to prepare your order for shipping.  This typically takes 1 – 2 days however, some orders may ship within as few as 4 hrs and some may take up to 5 days. </li>
<br><br>
<li>Transit Time: The amount of time it takes your order to leave our distribution center and arrive at the local delivery carrier.</li></ul>

<p>When the delivery provider receives your order and is ready to schedule a delivery date, they will attempt to contact you at the telephone number that you provided in your order.  At that time, they will let you know what days of the week they are able to deliver to your area.  Deliveries will be made between the hours of 8am and 10pm on the delivery day you select.  The delivery company will call you prior to the scheduled delivery and will provide you with an approximate time window.  The delivery company will make every effort to deliver within the time window provided. </p>
<br>
<a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a><b>1.2 How to prepare for your delivery? </b>
<p> The Delivery Company has been contracted to perform the delivery service to one room of choice at the delivery address.  If the delivery cannot be made to this room, the transporters will place your products in an alternate room at the same address.  Please make sure there is adequate access and space to complete the delivery – prior to delivery ensure that there is adequate room to make the delivery considering hallways, staircases and elevators. </p>
<br>
<a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a><b>1.3 Who needs to sign for my delivery? </b>
<p> Either you or your representative, that is 18 years of age or older, must be present to receive the merchandise at the agreed upon day and time window.  If no one is available to receive the delivery, a re-delivery fee may be applied to your order.  This agreement is with you and IKEA.  Neither IKEA nor the 3rd party Delivery Company that has been contracted by IKEA to perform the delivery will be held responsible if you decide to hire a 3rd party contractor to accept, receive and sign the handover of items without the notations of visible defects of packaging, damaged items, or missing merchandise.</p>
<br>
<a id="1.4" name="1.4"></a><b>1.4 What am I responsible for upon delivery? </b>
 
<p>Please be sure to sign the Delivery Order Note in the presence of the Delivery Company representative to indicate your delivery has been received.  Examine your order upon delivery to ensure that there are no visible signs of damaged, missing or incorrect pieces. In the event that there are missing, damaged or incorrect packages, please retain the item(s), indicate the problem on the Delivery Note and contact us at 1-888-434-IKEA (4532) within 48 hours of your delivery.  A signed delivery receipt, without notations of missing, damaged or incorrect item(s) represents your acceptance of the complete order in perfect condition.  For any other problem with your order, please refer to our <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/return_policy/index.html">return policy</a>.<br>
<br>
<a id="1.5" name="1.5"></a><b>1.5 What additional fees may apply? </b>

</p><p>There may be circumstances that require additional payment by you if the conditions mentioned have not been met or you require special services outside of our standard delivery. </p>
<blockquote>[For example, if you need a specified time window, your address is not tractor trailer accessible, you were not available for your scheduled delivery, delivery not made due to unsafe conditions, not indicating missing pieces on the delivery note, etc.]</blockquote>
<br>
<a id="1.6" name="1.6"></a><b>1.6 Delivering to a Tradeshow or Convention Center? </b>


<p>In order to ensure that your delivery is processed as quickly as possible; please contact us by calling 1.800.434.IKEA.

When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/linked-with-information-about-visits-to-multiple-sites.html" id="linked-with-information-about-visits-to-multiple-sites">linked, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites</a>.</p></li></ul></li></ul>
<h2 id="infouse">How we use information we collect</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/develop-new-ones.html" id="develop-new-ones">develop new ones</a>, and to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/protect-google-and-our-users.html" id="protect-google-and-our-users">protect Google and our users</a>. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
</p><p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo.
</p><p>If you have a Google Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Google or on third-party applications connected to your Google Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings.html" id="limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings">limit sharing or visibility settings</a> in your Google Account.
</p><p>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.
</p><p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-pixel">pixel tags</a>, to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/improve-your-user-experience.html" id="improve-your-user-experience">improve your user experience</a> and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</a>, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
</p><p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.
</p><p>We may <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/combine-personal-information.html" id="combine-personal-information">combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services</a> – for example <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/to-make-it-easier-to-share.html" id="to-make-it-easier-to-share">to make it easier to share things with people you know</a>. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.
</p><p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.
</p><h2 id="infochoices">Transparency and choice</h2>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/accounthistory?hl=en">Visit your Google Account History</a> for settings that allow you to control the collection of personal information from Google services, such as Search, YouTube and Location History.
</li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Review and control</a> certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.
</li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/preferences?hl=en">View and edit</a> your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.
</li><li><a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1355890?hl=en">Adjust</a> how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.
</li><li><a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=1257347">Control</a> who you share information with through your Google Account.
</li><li><a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Take information</a> associated with your Google Account out of many of our services.
</li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/settings/endorsements">Choose</a> whether your Profile name and Profile photo appear in shared endorsements that appear in ads.</li></ul>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/may-not-function-properly.html" id="may-not-function-properly">may not function properly</a> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.
</p><h2 id="infosharing">Information you share</h2>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sharing.html" id="sharing">sharing</a> and <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/removing-your-content.html" id="removing-your-content">removing your content</a>.
</p><h2 id="access">Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/access-to-your-personal-information.html" id="access-to-your-personal-information">access to your personal information</a>. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
</p><p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
</p><p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
</p><h2 id="nosharing">Information we share</h2>
<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>With your consent</strong>
</p><p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-info">sensitive personal information</a>.
</p></li><li>
<p><strong>With domain administrators</strong>
</p><p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a <a href="http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=178897">domain administrator</a> (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to:
</p><ul>
<li>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install.
</li><li>change your account password.
</li><li>suspend or terminate your account access.
</li><li>access or retain information stored as part of your account.
</li><li>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/legal-process.html" id="legal-process">legal process or enforceable governmental request</a>.
</li><li>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</li></ul>
<p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information.
</p></li><li>
<p><strong>For external processing</strong>
</p><p>We provide personal information to our <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-affiliates">affiliates</a> or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
</p></li><li>
<p><strong>For legal reasons</strong>
</p><p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
</p><ul>
<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
</li><li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
</li><li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
</li><li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/we-may-share-aggregated.html" id="we-may-share-aggregated">We may share aggregated</a>, <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-info">non-personally identifiable information</a> publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/to-show-trends.html" id="to-show-trends">to show trends</a> about the general use of our services.
</p><p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</p><h2 id="infosecurity">Information security</h2>
<p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
</p><ul>
<li>We encrypt many of our services <a href="http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=173733&amp;en">using SSL</a>.
</li><li>We offer you <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/">two step verification</a> when you access your Google Account, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/security.html">Safe Browsing feature</a> in Google Chrome.
</li><li>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
</li><li>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li></ul>
<h2 id="application">When this Privacy Policy applies</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including YouTube, and services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.

<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several <a href="../../policies/privacy/frameworks/">self regulatory frameworks</a>. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
</p><h2 id="policychanges">Changes</h2>
<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes).
